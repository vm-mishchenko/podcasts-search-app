        <description>Recommender Systems are the most challenging, powerful and ubiquitous area of machine learning and
            artificial intelligence. This podcast hosts the experts in recommender systems research and application.
            From understanding what users really want to driving large-scale content discovery - from delivering
            personalized online experiences to catering to multi-stakeholder goals. Guests from industry and academia
            share how they tackle these and many more challenges. With Recsperts coming from universities all around the
            globe or from various industries like streaming, ecommerce, news, or social media, this podcast provides
            depth and insights. We go far beyond your 101 on RecSys and the shallowness of another matrix factorization
            based rating prediction blogpost! The motto is: be relevant or become irrelevant!

                <![CDATA[<p>In episode 17 of Recsperts, we meet Miguel Fierro who is a Principal Data Science Manager at Microsoft and holds a PhD in robotics. We talk about the Microsoft recommenders repository with over 15k stars on GitHub and discuss the impact of LLMs on RecSys. Miguel also shares his view of the T-shaped data scientist.</p><p>In our interview, Miguel shares how he transitioned from robotics into personalization as well as how the Microsoft recommenders repository started. We learn more about the three key components: examples, library, and tests. With more than 900 tests and more than 30 different algorithms, this library demonstrates a huge effort of open-source contribution and maintenance. We hear more about the principles that made this effort possible and successful. Therefore, Miguels also shares the reasoning behind evidence-based design to put the users of microsoft-recommenders and their expectations first. We also discuss the impact that recent LLM-related innovations have on RecSys.</p><p>At the end of the episode, Miguel explains the T-shaped data professional as an advice to stay competitive and build a champion data team. We conclude with some remarks regarding the adoption and ethical challenges recommender systems pose and which need further attention.</p><p>Enjoy this enriching episode of RECSPERTS - Recommender Systems Experts.<br>Don't forget to follow the podcast and please leave a review</p><p></p><ul>

                <![CDATA[<p>In episode 16 of Recsperts, we hear from Michael D. Ekstrand, Associate Professor at Boise State University, about fairness in recommender systems.

We discuss several stages at which biases can enter the system as well as how bias can indeed support mitigating unfairness.

                <![CDATA[<p>In episode 16 of Recsperts, we hear from Michael D. Ekstrand, Associate Professor at Boise State University, about fairness in recommender systems. We discuss why fairness matters and provide an overview of the multidimensional fairness-aware RecSys landscape. Furthermore, we talk about tradeoffs, methods and receive practical advice on how to get started with tackling unfairness.</p><p>In our discussion, Michael outlines the difference and similarity between fairness and bias. We discuss several stages at which biases can enter the system as well as how bias can indeed support mitigating unfairness. We also cover the perspectives of different stakeholders with respect to fairness. We also learn that measuring fairness depends on the specific fairness concern one is interested in and that solving fairness universally is highly unlikely.</p><p>Towards the end of the episode, we take a look at further challenges as well as how and where the upcoming RecSys 2023 provides a forum for those interested in fairness-aware recommender systems.</p><p>Enjoy this enriching episode of RECSPERTS - Recommender Systems Experts.</p><p></p><ul>

                <![CDATA[<p>In episode number 14 of Recsperts we talk to Daniel Svonava, CEO and Co-Founder of Superlinked, delivering user modeling infrastructure. In his former role he was a senior software engineer and tech lead at YouTube working on ad performance prediction and pricing.</p><p>We discuss the crucial role of user modeling for recommendations and discovery. Daniel presents two examples from YouTube’s ad performance forecasting to demonstrate the bandwidth of use cases for user modeling. We also discuss sources of information that fuel user models and additional personlization tasks that benefit from it like user onboarding. We learn that the tight combination of user modeling with (near) real-time updates is key to a sound personalized user experience.</p><p>Daniel also shares with us how Superlinked provides personalization as a service beyond ecommerce-centricity. Offering personalized recommendations of items and people across various industries and use cases is what sets Superlinked apart.

We also briefly touch on RecSysOps for detecting, predicting, diagnosing and resolving issues in a large-scale recommender systems and how it helps to alleviate item cold-start.</p><p>In the end of this episode, we talk about the company culture at Netflix. Key elements are freedom and responsibility as well as providing context instead of exerting control. We hear that being really comfortable with feedback is important for high-performance people and teams.</p><p><br>Enjoy this enriching episode of RECSPERTS - Recommender Systems Experts.</p><p><strong>Chapters:<br></strong></p><ul>

                <![CDATA[<p>In episode number six, we welcome Manel Slokom to the show and talk about purpose-aware privacy-preserving data for recommender systems. Manel is a 4th year PhD student at Delft University of Technology. For three years in a row she served as student volunteer at RecSys - before becoming student volunteer co-chair herself in 2021. Besides working on privacy and fairness, she also dedicates herself to simulation and in particular synthetic data for recommender systems - also co-organizing the 1st SimuRec Workshop as part of RecSys 2021.</p><p>This episode is definitely worth a longer run. Manel and I discussed fairness and privacy in recommender systems and how ratings can leak signals about sensitive personal information. For example, classifiers may exploit ratings in order to effectively determine one's gender.

                <![CDATA[<p>In episode number six, we welcome Manel Slokom to the show and talk about purpose-aware privacy-preserving data for recommender systems. Manel is a 4th year PhD student at Delft University of Technology. For three years in a row she served as student volunteer at RecSys - before becoming student volunteer co-chair herself in 2021. Besides working on privacy and fairness, she also dedicates herself to simulation and in particular synthetic data for recommender systems - also co-organizing the 1st SimuRec Workshop as part of RecSys 2021.</p><p>This episode is definitely worth a longer run. Manel and I discussed fairness and privacy in recommender systems and how ratings can leak signals about sensitive personal information. For example, classifiers may exploit ratings in order to effectively determine one's gender. She explains "Personalized Blurring", which is the approach she developed to personalize gender obfuscation in user rating data, as well as how this can contribute to more diverse recommendations.<br>In our discussion, we also touch "data-centric AI", a term recently formulated by Andrew Ng, and how adapting feedback data may yield underestimated effects on recommendations that can lead to "data-centric recommender systems".

                <![CDATA[<p>In episode four my guest is Felice Merra, who is an applied scientist at Amazon. Felice obtained his PhD from Politecnico di Bari where he was a researcher at the Information Systems Lab (SisInf Lab). There, he worked on Security and Adversarial Machine Learning in Recommender Systems.</p><p>We talk about different ways to perturb interaction or content data, but also model parameters, and elaborated various defense strategies.<br>In addition, we touch on the motivation of individuals or whole platforms to perform attacks and look at some examples that Felice has been working on throughout his research.<br>The overall goals of research in Adversarial Machine Learning for Recommender Systems is to identify vulnerabilities of models and systems in order to derive proper defense strategies that make systems more robust against potential attacks.<br>Finally, we also briefly discuss privacy-preserving learning and the challenges of further robustification of multimedia recommender systems.</p><p>Felice has published multiple papers at KDD, ECIR, SIGIR, and RecSys.

                <![CDATA[<p>In this first interview we talk to Kim Falk, Senior Data Scientist, multiple RecSys Industry Chair and author of the book "Practical Recommender Systems". We introduce into recommenders from a practical perspective discussing the fundamental difference between content-based and collaborative filtering as well as the cold-start problem - no mathematical deep-dive yet, but expect it to follow. In addition, we reason what constitutes good recommendations and briefly touch on a couple of ways of finding that out.<br>Looking a bit into the history of the recommender systems community, we touch on the Netflix Prize that was running from 2006 to 2009 as well as on the RecSys - the leading conference in recommender systems, where we also met for the first time.<br>In the end, we discuss a couple of challenges the field faces, in particular associated with approaches based on deep learning. Besides that, Spiderman will accompany our conversation at certain times. Plus many practical recommendations included on how to get started.

The answer is personalization and in this show we focus on the most prominent way to achieve personalization: <strong>recommender systems</strong>.<br>Whether you are a beginner and new to the field or you have already build recommenders, this show is to bring you the experts in recommender systems to share their knowledge and expertise with all of us. It is for making the topic more accessible and to provide a regular coverage of basics and advances in recommender systems research and application. I invite the experts to share their insights and to provide you with the right knowledge to get started and gain expertise yourself.</p><p>In this introductory episode I am going to share some exemplary use cases from different industries (music streaming, e-commerce, travel, or social networks) along with challenges and problems in research and application.
