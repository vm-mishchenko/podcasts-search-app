The Chinese government has put a pause on releasing some of its official economic data. But many of the stories emerging from the country paint a clear picture: the second largest economy in the world is struggling.\nToday, our friends at The Indicator share some of their recent reporting on China. First up, it's a special edition of the Beigie Awards focused entirely on China. What can the approach of the Federal Reserve's Beige Book - i.e. looking at anecdotes that tell us something about where the economy is headed - show us about China's economy?\nThen, we take a deep dive into one of the most alarming indicators in China: the skyrocketing urban youth unemployment rate.\nThis episode was hosted by Darian Woods, Wailin Wong, and Robert Smith. The original Indicator episodes were produced by Corey Bridges with engineering by Robert Rodriguez. They were fact-checked by Cooper Katz McKim and Sierra Juarez.

Because they are both H-1B recipients, they only have 60 days to find new jobs before they risk being sent home. And they can't get just any job – they need new employers in their field willing to sponsor their visa.\nOn today's show, we followed two tech workers as they tried to find jobs before their visas expired, and what they went through as H-1B recipients trying to stay in the country.\nThis episode was hosted by Alyssa Jeong Perry and Amanda Aronczyk, produced by Sam Yellowhorse Kesler, engineered by James Willetts, fact-checked by Sierra Juarez, and edited by Molly Messick and Jess Jiang.\nHelp support Planet Money and get bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ in Apple Podcasts or at plus.npr.org/planetmoney.","guid":"9289fc84-7dc3-466a-972b-9888f577828e","isoDate":"2023-06-16T18:28:34.000Z","itunes":{"explicit":"no","duration":"1579","image":"https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2023/06/16/h-1b-visas-uscis-united-states-citizenship-immigration-services-tech-workers-layoffs_sq-79387d2c610668e3180a30115420bab1969141ac.jpeg?s=1900&c=66&f=jpeg","episode":"1649","episodeType":"full"}},{"title":"Two Indicators: The economics of innovation","link":"https://www.npr.org/2023/06/14/1182157986/the-economics-of-innovation","pubDate":"Wed, 14 Jun 2023 22:09:47 +0000","content:encoded":"Innovation is crucial for game-changing advancements in society, whether it's treatments for serious diseases, developments in AI technology, or rocket science.<br><br>Today on the show, we're airing two episodes from our daily economics show The Indicator.

And when things get confusing, we look to basic economic indicators to help explain what's going on. Today, we're bringing you two episodes of our daily show The Indicator that focus on the bond market.\nThe market for U.S. treasury bonds is generally safe, predictable and pretty boring. Recently, though, it's been anything but. We look into the fluctuations in bond prices and the yield curve (one of our favorite indicators) to try to help us understand where the economy stands right now.\nThese two Indicator episodes were originally produced by Brittany Cronin and Noah Glick.

Lonsinger is a member of the Ponca tribe of Oklahoma, who was adopted at a young age into a white family of three. He eventually reconnected with his birth family, but when his birth mother passed away in 2010, he wasn't included in the distribution of her estate. Feeling both hurt and excluded, he asked a judge to re-open her estate, to give him a part of one particular asset: an Osage headright.\nAn Osage headright is a share of profits from resources like oil, gas, and coal that have been extracted from the Osage Nation's land. These payments can be sizeable - thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars a year. Historically, they were even larger – in the 1920s the Osage were some of the wealthiest people in the world. But that wealth also made them a target and subject to paternalistic and predatory laws. Over the previous century, hundreds of millions of dollars in oil money have been taken from the Osage people.\nOn today's show: the story of how Richard Lonsinger gradually came to learn this history, and how he made his peace with his part of a complicated inheritance. \nThis episode was produced by Willa Rubin with help from Alyssa Jeong Perry and Emma Peaslee.
