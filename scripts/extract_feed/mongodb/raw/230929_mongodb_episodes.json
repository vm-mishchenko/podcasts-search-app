    "description": "<p>In this podcast episode, the host interviews Jay Runkel, Distinguished Solutions Architect at MongoDB, about application-driven analytics. Traditionally, analytics were done in batches by a special-purpose data warehousing analytical tool. However, with app-driven analytics, the application provides real-time visibility into what is happening right now. MongoDB is uniquely positioned in this arena due to its powerful query language and distributed architecture. MongoDB's distributed architecture allows users to dedicate certain nodes to analytics and other nodes to operational queries. MongoDB's Atlas platform also allows users to easily add dedicated analytical nodes, which can be configured separately from the nodes that handle operational queries. This is beneficial from a cost perspective because users can choose to allocate resources as needed for different types of queries. </p><p><br></p><p>Visit <a href=\"https://mdb.link/rocket\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://mdb.link/rocket</a> for more details about the livestream.</p>",

MongoDB's distributed architecture allows users to dedicate certain nodes to analytics and other nodes to operational queries. MongoDB's Atlas platform also allows users to easily add dedicated analytical nodes, which can be configured separately from the nodes that handle operational queries. This is beneficial from a cost perspective because users can choose to allocate resources as needed for different types of queries.\n",

Initially they stood up their own on-prem MongoDB database to learn more, but then soon realised that moving to Atlas was key, particularly as they could host on Azure.</p><p><br></p><p>For Global Logic's client, Catalina, Jan manages everything from small clusters with a few hundred records all the way up to a system of 7 clusters with over 5Billion data records!So he know’s all about scaling - and teaches us some lessons he’s learnt along the way. He illustrates that if you only scale one large cluster (e.g with Autoscaling on), your database never gets a break!

    "metaDescription": "In this episode we’re talking about all things sizing - clusters, sharing, indexing and we’re joined by Jan Srniček of Catalina. \n\nWe first came across Jan via his talk from MongoDB world, where he spoke about the journey he and his team took in understanding how to reduce usage & cost - all the while keeping performance and responsiveness high. \n\nIn this episode, Jan talks about his journey with MongoDB, moving from Cosmo DB to MongoDB. Initially they stood up their own on-prem MongoDB database to learn more, but then soon realised that moving to Atlas was key, particularly as they could host on Azure.\n\nFor Catalina, Jan manages everything from small clusters with a few hundred records all the way up to a system of 7 clusters with over 5Billion data records!So he know’s all about scaling - and teaches us some lessons he’s learnt along the way. He illustrates that if you only scale one large cluster (e.g with Autoscaling on), your database never gets a break! However, if you have smaller clusters, all autoscaling, along with predictable traffic patterns visualised by using Atlas metrics UI and performance advisor, you can analyse usage and re-organise structure appropriately.\n\nUltimately, understanding the workloads in your application and dividing those across clusters all working together is key to application performance.\n",

We're joined by Kris Jenkins, Developer Advocate from Confluent, and Rob Walters, Product Manager at MongoDB, who will discuss how you can leverage this technology to your benefit and use it in your applications.</p><p><br></p><p>Kafka is traditionally used for building real time streaming data pipelines and real time streaming applications. It began its life in 2010 at LinkedIn and made its way to the public open-source space through a relationship with Apache, the Apache Foundation, in 2011. Since then, the use of Kafka has grown massively and it's estimated that approximately 30% of all Fortune 500 companies are already using Kafka in one way or another. </p><p><br></p><p>A great example for why you might want to use Kafka would be perhaps capturing all of the user activity that happens on your website. As users visit your website, they're interacting with links on the page and scrolling up and down. This is potentially large volumes of data.

Since then I've been a contractor for a wide variety of companies in the startup and/or finance space, ranging from fledgling retail platforms to blockchain companies and large banks.\n\nI've been told by many people that I'm good at explaining technology to non-­technical people; at pulling a great product out of a loosely-­formed requirement; and building software to a high degree of polish.\n\nOutside of contracting I have run several regular coding events in London, with a mix of hackathons and educational events.

        "description": "I am a senior product leader at MongoDB where I work on MongoDB Cloud, our cloud data platform. What I love doing best is identifying and solving complex problems using metrics and data, and leading customer-centered strategies that expand our customer base and unlock growth. A skilled product manager at heart, I can quickly move from high-level white-boarding and ideation to diving deep into product usage metrics, talking with customers, and figuring out bugs with engineering. \n\nBefore MongoDB, I founded Manner.io, developing a platform for the growing commercial insurance marketplace in Australia, and served as Spotad’s Operations leader and GM for North America during a period of rapid expansion. At Spotad, I owned two separate product lines and led my newly-built team in massively scaling revenue and optimizing gross margin.\n\nI firmly believe that high-impact ideas are rooted in data, testing, and a deep sense of customer empathy. I value my teams and use my passion for innovation and collaboration to drive them to deliver double-digit growth for our company. When I’m not working, I love mentoring and advising startups at every stage, and I am interested in a range of sectors, including data, edtech, fintech, health, and AI."

You don't need any additional MongoDB drivers, libraries, or connection strings; just a standard HTTP client and a valid API key.</p> <p>The Data API's endpoints expose actions that are similar to the standard query methods available in MongoDB drivers. You can call them to create, read, update, delete, or aggregate documents in your cluster. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sumedhamehta/\">Sumedha Mehta</a> is the Product Manager responsible for the Data API and she joins Michael for a brief introduction to the product, how it works as well as its benefits. </p> <p>Be sure to check the links below for resources, examples and documentation to help get you started.</p> <p><strong>Screencast Tutorial (Youtube): </strong></p> <ul> <li><a href= \"https://youtu.be/aVRnDu_BYy8\">https://youtu.be/aVRnDu_BYy8</a></li> </ul> <p><strong>Documentation:</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href= \"https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/api/data-api/\">https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/api/data-api/</a></li> </ul> <p><strong>Blog Article by John Page:</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href= \"https://www.mongodb.com/developer/quickstart/atlas_data_api_introduction/\"> https://www.mongodb.com/developer/quickstart/atlas_data_api_introduction/</a></li> </ul> <p> </p>",

    "description": "<p class=\"css-1hzcd52 e1top8006\">The network edge has been one of the most explosive cloud computing opportunities in recent years. As mobile contactless experiences become the norm and as businesses move ever-faster to digital platforms and services, edge computing is positioned as a faster, cheaper, and more reliable alternative for data processing and compute at scale.</p> <p class=\"css-1hzcd52 e1top8006\">While mobile devices continue to increase their hardware capabilities with built-in GPUs, custom chipsets, and more storage, even the most cutting-edge devices will suffer the same fundamental problem: each device serves as a single point of failure and, thus, cannot effectively serve as a persistent data storage layer. Said differently, wouldn’t it be nice to have the high-availability of the cloud but with the topological distance to your end users of the smartphone?</p> <p class=\"css-1hzcd52 e1top8006\">Mobile edge computing promises to precisely address this problem—bringing low latency compute to the edge of networks with the high-availability and scale of cloud computing. Through Verizon 5G Edge with AWS Wavelength, we saw the opportunity to explore how to take existing compute-intensive workflows and overlay a data persistence layer with MongoDB, utilizing the MongoDB Atlas management platform, to enable ultra-immersive experiences with personalized experience—reliant on existing database structures in the parent region with the seamlessness to extend to the network edge.</p> <p class=\"css-1hzcd52 e1top8006\">In this episode, we welcome <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertbelson/\">Robbie Belson</a> of Verizon to help us understand this fascinating landscape and its potential. If you're curious about how 5G, and Mobile Edge Computing and the impact it can have on your applications, listen in and check out an in-depth article on the topic on the MongoDB Developer Hub: <a href= \"https://www.mongodb.com/developer/how-to/real-time-data-architectures-with-mongodb-cloud-manager-and-verizon-5g-edge/\"> https://www.mongodb.com/developer/how-to/real-time-data-architectures-with-mongodb-cloud-manager-and-verizon-5g-edge/</a></p> <p class=\"css-1hzcd52 e1top8006\"> </p>",
