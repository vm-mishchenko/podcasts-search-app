Everyone in a group, at the same time, gets stuck following a norm that no one wants to follow, because everyone is carrying a shared, false belief about everyone else’s unshared true beliefs.\r\n-- Show Notes at: youarenotsosmart.com --\r\n-- Become a patron at: www.patreon.com/youarenotsosmart --\r\nSPONSORS\r\n• BetterHelp: BetterHelp.com -

In this show, you’ll learn how.\nPatreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart","guid":"tag:soundcloud,2010:tracks/412215969","isoDate":"2018-03-11T22:17:21.000Z","itunes":{"author":"You Are Not So Smart","subtitle":"Little did the champions of the Enlightenment kno…","summary":"Little did the champions of the Enlightenment kno…","explicit":"no","duration":"00:28:19","image":"https://image.simplecastcdn.com/images/aa9f26/aa9f2648-25e9-472a-af42-4e5017da38cf/704ef35b-f1d3-41c0-8619-a96cf9e3ee90/3000x3000/image.jpg?aid=rss_feed","episodeType":"full"}},{"creator":"davidmcraney@gmail.com (You Are Not So Smart)","title":"122 - Tribal Psychology","link":"https://www.stitcher.com","pubDate":"Mon, 26 Feb 2018 07:41:20 +0000","author":"davidmcraney@gmail.com (You Are Not So Smart)","content:encoded":"<p>The evidence is clear that humans value being good members of their tribes much more than they value being correct.

Innovation took place in the spaces between disciplines, when people outside of intellectual and professional silos, unrestrained by categorical and linear views, synthesized the work of people still trapped in those institutions, who, because of those institutions, had no idea what each other was up to and therefore couldn’t predict the trajectory of even their own disciplines, much less history itself.<br /><br />In The Day the Universe Changed, Burke explored the sequential impact of discovery, innovation, and invention on how people defined reality itself. “You are what we know,” he wrote “and when the body of knowledge changes, so do we.” In this view of change, knowledge is invented as much as it is discovered, and new ideas “nibble at the edges” of common knowledge until values considered permanent and fixed fade into antiquity just like any other obsolete tool. Burke said that our system of knowledge and discovery has never been able, until recently, to handle more than one or two ways of seeing things at a time.

It is very easy to be both unskilled and unaware of it, and in this episode we explore why that is with professor David Dunning, one of the researchers who coined the term and a scientist who continues to add to our understanding of the phenomenon.\n• Show Notes: http://bit.ly/1NfbAhf\n• Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/youarenotsosmart\n• Donate Directly through PayPal: https://www.paypal.me/DavidMcRaney\nSPONSORS\n• The Great Courses Plus: https://www.thegreatcoursesplus.com/smart\nPatreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart","guid":"tag:soundcloud,2010:tracks/254730976","isoDate":"2016-03-24T00:46:09.000Z","itunes":{"author":"You Are Not So Smart","subtitle":"In this episode, we explore why we are unaware th…","summary":"In this episode, we explore why we are unaware th…","explicit":"no","duration":"01:05:20","image":"https://image.simplecastcdn.com/images/aa9f26/aa9f2648-25e9-472a-af42-4e5017da38cf/748f2dcb-5bf0-4280-b92f-d6ad5ca96873/3000x3000/image.jpg?aid=rss_feed","episodeType":"full"}},{"creator":"davidmcraney@gmail.com (You Are Not So Smart)","title":"071 - The Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy","link":"https://www.stitcher.com","pubDate":"Wed, 9 Mar 2016 18:48:53 +0000","author":"davidmcraney@gmail.com (You Are Not So Smart)","content:encoded":"<p>When you desire meaning, when you want things to line up, when looking for something specific, you tend to notice patterns everywhere, which leads you to ask the question, “What are the odds?” Usually, the odds are actually pretty good.<br /><br /><br />For instance: Does the Bermuda Triangle seem quite as mysterious once you know that just about any triangle of that size drawn over the globe just about anywhere planes and ships frequently travel will contain as many, if not more, missing planes and ships?<br /><br />Drawing circles (or triangles) around the spots where randomness clusters together seemingly chance events is called The Texas Sharpshooter fallacy, and it is one of the easiest mistakes to make when trying to understand big, complex sets of data.<br /><br />Though some things in life seem too amazing to be coincidence, too odd to be random, too similar to be chance, given enough time (and enough events) randomness will begin to clump up in places.

Once you’ve wrapped your mind around that idea, you’ll then learn how to spot the straw man fallacy, how to avoid committing it, and how to defend against it.\n• Show Notes: http://bit.ly/1VN5PPP\n• Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/youarenotsosmart\n• Donate Directly through PayPal: https://www.paypal.me/DavidMcRaney\nSPONSORS\n• Trunk Club: http://bit.ly/1Sp2wZj\n• The Great Courses Plus: http://bit.ly/26kDXpU\n• SquareSpace: http://www.squarespace.com -

Instead, they say our “repeated attempts at dialogue with those on the ‘other side’ of a contentious issue make us aware that they rarely yield to our attempts at enlightenment; nor do they yield to the efforts of articulate, fair-minded spokespersons who share our views.” In other words, it’s naive to think evidence presented from the sources you trust will sway your opponents because when they do the same, it never sways you.\nListen in this episode as legendary psychologist Lee Ross explains how to identify, avoid, and combat this most pernicious of cognitive mistakes.\nPatreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart","guid":"tag:soundcloud,2010:tracks/231639138","isoDate":"2015-11-05T07:26:02.000Z","itunes":{"author":"You Are Not So Smart","subtitle":"In psychology, they call it naive realism, the te…","summary":"In psychology, they call it naive realism, the te…","explicit":"no","duration":"01:00:58","image":"https://image.simplecastcdn.com/images/aa9f26/aa9f2648-25e9-472a-af42-4e5017da38cf/9154a982-6472-4a48-80b8-64973529199d/3000x3000/image.jpg?aid=rss_feed","episodeType":"full"}},{"creator":"davidmcraney@gmail.com (You Are Not So Smart)","title":"061 - Mindfulness - Michael Taft","link":"https://www.stitcher.com","pubDate":"Thu, 22 Oct 2015 05:40:34 +0000","author":"davidmcraney@gmail.com (You Are Not So Smart)","content:encoded":"<p>You have the power to wield neuroplasticity to your advantage.<br /><br />Just as you can change your body at the atomic level by lifting weights, you can willfully alter your brain by...thinking in a certain way.

Would hearing those words improve your performance on a difficult test?\n\nIn this episode we learn the answers to these questions and more as we explore how research continues to unravel the mysteries behind the placebo effect and how it can drastically alter our bodies and minds.\n\nOur guest is Kristi Erdal, a psychologist at Colorado College who discovered placebo sleep along with one of her students, Christina Draganich. Draganich wondered if such a thing might exist after reading all the literature on placebos, and Erdal helped her create the research methods she used to test her hypothesis.\nPatreon: http://patreon.com/youarenotsosmart","enclosure":{"length":"67365771","type":"audio/mpeg","url":"https://stitcher.simplecastaudio.com/aa9f2648-25e9-472a-af42-4e5017da38cf/episodes/a33abb97-dd05-4532-8551-cdc50b7fbd12/audio/128/default.mp3?aid=rss_feed&awCollectionId=aa9f2648-25e9-472a-af42-4e5017da38cf&awEpisodeId=a33abb97-dd05-4532-8551-cdc50b7fbd12&feed=N5eKDxJI"},"content":"<p>How powerful is the placebo effect?

Are all these new communication tools turning us into navel-gazing human/brand hybrids, or are we developing a new set of senses that allow us to benefit from never severing contact with the people most important to us?\n\nThat's the topic of this episode of the You Are Not So Smart Podcast, and to answer these questions we welcome this episode's guest, Clive Thompson, who is the author of Smarter Than You Think: How Technology is Changing Our Minds for the Better. As the title suggests, he disagrees with the naysayers, and his book is an impressive investigation into why they are probably (thankfully) wrong. Thompson is a journalist whose work can be found published in Wired, The Washington Post, and the New York Times Magazine. You can learn more about him at his website, CollisionDetection.Net.\n\nAfter the interview, I discuss a news story about research into how the way you walk can encourage or discourage criminals to attack you.\n\nIn every episode, before I read a bit of self delusion news, I taste a cookie baked from a recipe sent in by a listener/reader.
